VUE-application for currency exchange
=====================

    The application allows you to exchange currencies, namely bitcoins and hryvnia. 
    Data with the current rate is pulled from the [site](https://kuna.io/api/v2/tickers/btcuah).
    The application contains localization for Russian, Ukrainian and English.
    The currency has a certain reserve that cannot be exceeded.
    If the exchange is successful, the user will be redirected to the '/success' page (private, i.e. you cannot go without making an exchange).
